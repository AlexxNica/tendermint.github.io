# Stuff done thursday
* Improved the readability of some small text on mobile.
* Improved the site header design.
* Improved the Next/Prev Article footer element design.
* Improved the header design for the News/About/Dev/Docs pages.
* Improved the article list design on the News page and the Tutorials page.
* Overall color tweaks for better usability.

Changes are not live yet. I'll work on scaling the design for larger displays tomorrow, and push the changes live by the end of the work day.
