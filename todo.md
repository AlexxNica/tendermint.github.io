* Moved most of the site over to Vue.
* Added a Github link to the site header.
* Created the new empty Intro, Docs, Community pages
* Design, font improvements.

It's in the `redesign-vue` branch. I'll put up a live demo tomorrow with the new content

I'll move all the content from the `redesign` branch into it tomorrow, and put a live version of the site.
