# Stuff done today
* Started on general site design improvements. Haven't pushed it live yet.
* Deleted and improved the organized a lot of the tmweb template files to comply with the latest version of Hugo
* Fixed several design bugs around the site.
* Renamed 'Blog' to 'News' for clarity, because we're adding another blog (presentations) to the site.
