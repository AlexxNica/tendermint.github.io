<!--
  This file defines how a summary of a specifc post should be presented in a
  list (hence the file name li.html for "list item"). This is used in the
  template /layouts/indexes/posts.html

  The lines of the displayed list item are as follows:
  (1) The name of the post
  (2) The date the post was written as left-justified text and a
      right-justified horizontal list of categories for that post.
  (3) The contents of the description field in the metadata of the actual
      markdown source of the post.
