          <li>Blockchains continue their journey - increasing functionality while decreasing development complexity.</li> 
          <li>First there was Bitcoin, an accounting system with limited functionality that is difficult to build on top of.</li>
          <li>Then came Ethereum, which unlocked the potential of blockchains with a Turing-complete virtual machine that can run any smart contract written in Serpent or Solidity.</li> 
          <li>Now with Tendermint <a href="http://tendermint.com/posts/tendermint-socket-protocol/">TMSP</a>, you can write smart-contracts in any programming language. Leverage existing codebases, workflows, and development ecosystems to build complex &amp; production-quality applications.</li>
