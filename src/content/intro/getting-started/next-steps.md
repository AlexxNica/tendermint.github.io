By now you've seen how to run a simple example TMSP application on a local Tendermint node
and on a remote Tendermint cluster. 

To learn more about building TMSP applications and integrating with Tendermint, see the <router-link to="/docs/guides/app-development">Developer Guides</router-link>.

To learn more about Tendermint's various pieces, checkout the <router-link to="/docs">Documentation</router-link>.

For examples and inspiration, see Tendermint's <router-link to="/ecosystem">Software Ecosystem</router-link>.

Collaborate with other developers working with Tendermint on the <router-link to="/community">Community</router-link> page.

You can also <router-link to="/contact">get in touch with the team</router-link>.
