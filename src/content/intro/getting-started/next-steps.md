# Next Steps

By now you've seen how to run a simple example TMSP application on a local Tendermint node
and on a remote Tendermint cluster. 

To learn more about building TMSP applications and integrating with Tendermint, see the [developer guides](/docs/guides/app-development).

To learn more about Tendermint's various pieces, checkout the [documentation](/docs).

For examples and inspiration, see the [list of TMSP applications](/ecosystem).

Collaborate with other developers working with Tendermint by [joining our community](/community).

You can also get in touch with the team [directly](/contact).
