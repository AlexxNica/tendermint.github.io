# Next Steps

By now you've seen how to run a simple example TMSP application on a local Tendermint node
and on a remote Tendermint cluster. 

To learn more about building TMSP applications and integrating with Tendermint, see the <router-link to="/docs/guides/app-development">Developer Guides</router-link>.

To learn more about Tendermint's various pieces, checkout the <router-link to="/docs">Documentation</router-link>.
For a deeper dive, see [this thesis](https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/xmlui/handle/10214/9769). 
There is also the [original whitepaper](~assets/docs/tendermint.pdf), though it is now quite outdated.

The Tendermint <router-link to="/ecosystem">Software Ecosystem</router-link> contains many example applications and related software built by the Tendermint team and others. Check it out for some inspiration!

See our <router-link to="/community">Community</router-link> page for more ways to collaborate.

You can also <router-link to="/contact">get in touch with the team</router-link>.
